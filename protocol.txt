DroneDay Bluetooth communications protocol
==========================================

The communications protocol is a text-based one for simplicity. The drone
understands line-based text commands, with one command per line. Each
command is a single character (the first character on the line).

Valid commands:

  X<value>    - Set desired movement in X dimension (through tilt of rotors).
  Y<value>    - Set desired movement in Y dimension.
  Z<value>    - Set desired movement in Z dimension (vertical thrust).
  T<value>    - Set desired yaw rotation (rotation around Z axis).
  D           - Debug: dump values of X, Y, Z, T and possibly other things.
  #<command>  - Briefly put the Bluetooth module into AT monitor mode and
                execute the given command. Probably a very bad idea to do
                this while in the air because it will interrupt the normal
                control loop.
